# `lemex.experimental`: A toolkit for building your own little memex with Babashka

Stability: experimental.

I'm currently working on this toolkit while I'm working on my memexes (one public, more private).
If you want to help explore, then great! Get in touch.
If you're looking for something production ready, consider [Org-mode], [Org-roam], [Logseq], [Obsidian] or [TiddlyWiki].

## What is this?

I believe Clojure, Babashka and Pandoc makes a great foundation for a memex.
The best introduction to that idea is [a talk][lemex talk] I gave.

## How can I help?

My suggestion:

1. Watch the talk
2. Join [#memexes] on the Clojurians Slack
3. Build your own memex with Clojure tools
4. Share as you go!

## Installing `lemex.experimental` for evaluation

[neil] can be used to install a development Github dependency for evaluation:

    neil dep add io.github.teodorlu/lemex.experimental
